# Order Email Notification Fix

## Problem Description
Users were not receiving email notifications when placing orders, even though the system displayed a message stating "You will receive the details, status, or updates of your order via email."

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the order creation and payment webhook handlers where email notifications were not being sent. The notification system was only sending **INAPP** and **PUSH** notifications, but **EMAIL** notifications were missing.

## Files Modified

### 1. `services/order-service/src/controllers/order.js`
- **Issue**: `createOrder` function only sent `["INAPP", "PUSH"]` notifications
- **Fix**: Added `"EMAIL"` to notification types
- **Added**: Direct email confirmation using HTML templates

### 2. `services/order-service/src/controllers/payment.js`
- **Issue**: Payment webhook handler only sent `["INAPP", "PUSH"]` notifications
- **Fix**: Added `"EMAIL"` to notification types
- **Added**: Direct email confirmation using HTML templates

### 3. `packages/utils/notificationService.js`
- **Added**: New `sendOrderConfirmationEmail` function
- **Features**: 
  - Uses HTML email templates
  - Formats order data properly
  - Includes order items, pricing, and customer details
  - Professional email design with company branding

## Changes Made

### Notification Types Updated
```javascript
// Before
["INAPP", "PUSH"]

// After  
["INAPP", "PUSH", "EMAIL"]
```

### New Email Function Added
```javascript
exports.sendOrderConfirmationEmail = async (userEmail, orderData, token) => {
  // Sends HTML email with order details
  // Uses existing email templates
  // Includes order items, pricing, and contact info
}
```

### Email Template Integration
- Uses existing `orderConfirmationEmail` template from `packages/utils/email_templates/email_templates.js`

- Shows pricing breakdown
- Includes return instructions and support contact

## Email Features

3. **Pricing Breakdown**: Item prices, taxes, delivery charges
4. **Return Instructions**: Address and contact for returns
5. **Support Information**: Contact details for customer service
6. **Professional Design**: Company branding and responsive layout

### Email Template Structure:
- Header with company logo

## Testing

### Test Script Created: `test-order-email-notifications.js`
- Creates test orders with sample data
- Verifies email notifications are sent
- Checks all notification types (INAPP, PUSH, EMAIL)
- Provides debugging information

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Place a test order through the API
2. Check email inbox for confirmation
3. Verify email contains order details
4. Check application logs for email status
5. Test with different email providers

## Configuration Requirements

### SMTP Configuration
Ensure the following are properly configured in the user service:
- SMTP host and port
- Authentication credentials
- From name and email
- TLS/SSL settings

### Email Service Settings
Check `http://user-service:5001/api/appSetting/` endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "smtp": {
    "host": "smtp.example.com",
    "port": 587,
    "secure": false,
    "auth": {
      "user": "your-email@example.com",
      "pass": "your-password"
    },
    "fromName": "Toprise Ventures",
    "fromEmail": "noreply@toprise.in"
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Logs

### Success Indicators:
- `✅ Order confirmation email sent successfully`
- `✅ Notification created successfully`
- Email appears in customer inbox

### Error Indicators:
- `❌ Failed to send order confirmation email`
- `❌ Create notification error`
- SMTP connection errors

### Log Locations:
- Order service logs: Check for email sending status
- Notification service logs: Check for email processing
- SMTP logs: Check for email delivery status

## Deployment Notes

### Before Deployment:
1. Verify SMTP configuration is correct
2. Test email sending with test credentials
3. Ensure email templates are accessible
4. Check notification service is running

### After Deployment:
1. Test with real orders
2. Monitor email delivery rates
3. Check for any SMTP errors
4. Verify email templates render correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **SMTP Authentication Failed**: Check credentials in app settings
2. **Email Not Delivered**: Check spam folder, verify SMTP settings
3. **Template Errors**: Ensure email template functions are accessible
4. **Missing Order Data**: Verify order object structure matches template expectations

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check notification service logs
docker logs notification-service

# Check order service logs

# Test SMTP connection
node -e "const nodemailer = require('nodemailer'); /* test SMTP */"
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

### Additional Email Types:

## Summary

The email notification issue has been resolved by:
1. Adding EMAIL to notification types in order creation
2. Creating a dedicated order confirmation email function
3. Integrating HTML email templates for professional appearance
4. Adding proper error handling and logging
5. Creating test scripts for verification

Users will now receive proper email confirmations when placing orders, including detailed order information, product details, and support contact information.
